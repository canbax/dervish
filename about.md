## Inspiration
In drug discovery and drug repurposing, interactions between objects are significant. Graph (network) based inference can use and expose these interactions pretty efficiently. The graph-based inference is based on the topology of the graph. In addition to the topology, the attributes of objects can also play an important role in the analysis. As a result, benefiting from both the topological properties of the graph and data attributes can give the best results.

## What it does
- Search **ANY** `string` attribute inside the TigerGraph database easily.
- Filter attributes and types on `string` search.
- Search also in client-side data to highlight in the user interface.
- Run Interpreted query and Installed GSQL queries.
- Inspect attributes easily.
